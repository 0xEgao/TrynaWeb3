# Blockchain-Based Land Registry System

## 📖 Overview
Land records are critical data that require precise and secure storage. Integrating blockchain technology ensures transparency, immutability, and efficiency in managing land transactions. This system addresses the challenges in maintaining accurate land records by utilizing smart contracts and decentralized data storage.

## 🏢 Proposed System

### 🔒 Secure Data Storage
- Existing land transaction histories must first be approved by Revenue functionaries.
- Approved data is digitally signed and stored on the blockchain.
- This creates a trusted starting point for any future land mutations.

### 📜 Certificate Verification
- Revenue Department-issued certificates are stored on the blockchain.
- Other agencies (e.g., banks) can access this data for verification during land-related transactions.

### 🔄 Ownership and Transaction Updates
- Transactions like **sale**, **loan**, **mortgage**, **release of mortgage**, and **crop updates** are initiated by relevant departments.
- Verification of transaction details is done using blockchain data.
- Upon transaction approval (e.g., deed registration or bank loan approval), the details are stored on the blockchain.

### 📝 Registration Process
- The Registration Department retrieves survey number details from the blockchain to verify the seller's ownership.
- Once the purchaser and seller sign the sale deed, the scanned document is uploaded to the Blockchain Network, creating an immutable block.
- Each change in property title results in a new block, maintaining an untamperable chain of ownership.

### 🤖 Smart Contracts for Automation
- **Land Registration:** Automatically initiates mutation requests in land records.
- **Loan Approval:** Updates rights and liabilities upon bank approval.
- **Crop Updates:** Triggers automatic updates of cultivators and crop details in RTC.
- **Subsidy Payments:** Facilitates automatic payments to farmers in case of crop failure.
- **Eligibility Verification:** Confirms subsidy eligibility based on farmer type and blockchain data.
